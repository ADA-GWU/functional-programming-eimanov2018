Chosen 2 programming languages: C++ and F# in order to write a code, which reverses an array.

In order to run C++ code, you need to locate in the terminal to the folder path "/functional-programming-eimanov2018/Option A/C++"

Here you will see "imperative_hw4.cpp" C++ file:
  In order to execute the C++ code from the terminal, you need to compile the imperative_hw4.cpp:
  
              $ g++ imperative_hw4.cpp
  Then, run the compiled a.out file:
  
              $ ./a.out
  You will see in the terminal following interactions.
  Follow the instructions in the terminal and the result will be printed in the terminal
  
              > Write down the array of integers separated with space and end the array with any char:
              > 1 55 32 98 121 43
              > e
              > Start reversing
              > Printing the reversed array
              > 43 121 98 32 55 1
              
  
In order to run F# code, you need to locate in the terminal to the folder path "/functional-programming-eimanov2018/Option A/F#"

Here you will "main.fsx" which is .NET executable F# file:
  In order to execute the F# code from the terminal, you need to compile and run the main.fsx:
  Compilation and execution happens at once by executing the following command:
  
                $ dotnet fsi main.fsx
    You will see in the terminal following interactions.
    Follow the instructions in the terminal and the result will be printed in the terminal
                
                > Write down the array of integers separated with new line and end the array with Enter key:
                > 6
                > 1
                > 3
                > 6
                > 34
                > 99
                >
                > Array : [6; 1; 3; 6; 34; 99]
                > Printing the reversed array: [99; 34; 6; 3; 1; 6]
                > [any key to exit]
                >
